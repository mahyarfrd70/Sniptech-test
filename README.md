# Sniptech test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In this project I've focused on functionality instead of styles, so I didn't use much style for elements and components.
I used Material UI to use prepared components, and also Redux toolkit to make the code cleaner and simplify Redux's usage. in some cases that I needed to set style for a few elements I used Styled Components.

The more things that I think, they could have made the project better but I haven't implemented because of not existing in requirements were unit tests and validation for the form.

## Run project

to run the project, firt clone the project, then run `yarn install` and then `yarn start ` on the root directory.

## Example of searching

1. change the `Issue type` field to `repository` , then enter the existed repository with this pattern: `{owner}/{repo}` (replace the owner and repo with the proper one for example `octocat/hello-world`).
2. click on submit button.

and there is pagination at the end of the page that you can change the page by clicking on the desired page.
